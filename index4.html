	        <font size="+2">I study at LCC International University, which is located in Lithuania, Klaipeda. My major is contemporary communications, and right now is my sophomore year (Fall, 2022). As a freshman, I was excited to experience such a new, diverse culture as we have at LCC. Therefore, I got acquainted and became friends with people of different nationalities and backgrounds. I found a second family at university, which became my second home. To be clear, we did create a so-called "family" on the floor I was living on the previous year. Though we are all pretty much in different countries right now, this is something that is always going to stay in my heart. <br><br>Speaking of my university life this year, I am taking a leadership position(Fyrst Year Seminar Leader) and helping freshmen in their transition process to university. I hope to be able to participate in the exchange program next year and explore more of the opportunities that university has to offer!
